        <h2>Covid 19 tests on animals</h2>
         <p>Researchers Sarah Hamer and Lisa Auckland donned their masks and
           gowns as they pulled up to the suburban home in College Station,
           Tex. The family of three inside had had covid a few weeks earlier,
           and now it was time to check on the pets. Oreo the rabbit was his
           usual chill self, and Duke the golden retriever was a model patient,
           lying on his back as Hamer and Auckland swabbed their throats and
           took blood samples. But Ellie, a Jack Russell terrier,
           wiggled and barked in protest. “She was not exactly happy with us,”
           Auckland recalled. “But we’re trying to understand how transmission
           works within a household, so we needed samples from everyone.”

        <h2>How to Protect Yourself & Others</h2>
          <p>Preventive measures include physical or social distancing,
            quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs
            and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from
            the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended
            in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions.
